Yes that is correct the ESPATreadme.TXT is the driver in the Notes on item 4 it shows how to init the ESPAT from BASIC  - you need to replicate that really to use it.

1

.install /nextzxos/espat.drv
PRINT "Installed ESPAT.DRV"
BANK NEW %m: PRINT "ESPAT.SYS Load page ";%m
LOAD "/nextzxos/espat.sys" BANK %m,0,exactlength (will fix file at 8192 for simples)
DRIVER 78,1,%m:REM ensures DRV knows where SYS is and patches/initialises
BANK NEW %b: PRINT "Allocating 1 buffer ";%b
DRIVER 78,6,%b
DRIVER 78,9,0 TO %p : PRINT "115K Baud - precaler ";%p
DRIVER 78,3 : PRINT "IPD Driver started"

I.e. the driver does not install ESPAT.SYS into a BANK you have to load that file.


Basically call B=05 with Receive = 96 and send as 1024 I think fixed basic

DRIVER 78,5,96,1024

LOAD is nextreg $5x followed by fopen/fread/fclose
DRIVER is IDE_DRIVER
